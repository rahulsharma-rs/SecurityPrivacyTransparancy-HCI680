"""
Chapter 2: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Simulation
Healthcare Use Case: Alice needs both her password AND her phone to access
the EHR system, preventing Eve from breaking in with just a stolen password.

Learning Objectives:
- Understand the three authentication factors
- Learn how TOTP (Time-based One-Time Passwords) work
- See why MFA is critical in healthcare environments
